		<h2>Part 1. Description of VMFA and Overview of its Information System</h2>

		<h2>Part 2. Heuristic Evaluation and Usability Analysis of VMFA Website</h2>

		<h2>Part 3. Critical Analysis and Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<p>In 2014 VMFA launched what was then considered a revolutionary redesign of its website with the goal of providing mobile friendly access on tablets and smartphones and providing users with the ability to explore the museum’s permanent collection online. Robin Nicholson, the Deputy Director of Art and Education at VMFA stated, “it’s been a longtime goal to have the full breath of our permanent collection accessible online anywhere in the world.” At the time of that re-launch only 1,450 of the 3,300 works of art on view in the museum could be viewed on the website. The 2014 website redesign was also undertaken to improve navigation, provide improved access to most-requested information, streamline ticketing, and provide easier access to communication and social media channels. <br><br>
Fast-forward to 2025, VMFA unveiled a major website redesign undertaken to make the site more art-forward and provide a more user-friendly experience. In formulating its redesign, VMFA sought input from board members, donors, staff, VMFA members, educators, and the public through a series of listening sessions conducted with design firm Area 17. Like the 2014 redesign, the 2025 project was designed with the goal of inspiring user’s curiosity about the collection, providing users with online access to the collection, and providing a seamless, intuitive user experience. </p>
