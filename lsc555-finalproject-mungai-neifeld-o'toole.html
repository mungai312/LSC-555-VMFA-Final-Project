		<h2>Part 1. Description of VMFA and Overview of its Information System</h2>
<p>The VMFA originated in the donation of 50 paintings to the State of Virginia by Judge John Barton Payne in 1919. From that small donation it has grown to one of the largest comprehensive art museums in the United States. VMFA's growing encyclopedic collection houses more than 50,000 works of art spanning 6,000 years of world history. 

It is the only US art museum open 365 days a year with free general admission. Their holdings include the largest collection of Faberge' outside of Russia.</p>

		<h2>Part 3. Critical Analysis and Suggestions for Improvement</h2>

		<h3><I>Literature Review</I></h3>
		<p>Our review of the literature found that there is no established set of standards for evaluating museum websites. Several researchers have proposed sets of heuristics based on Neilsen's usability heuristics for websites in the cultural heritage environment (Lam 2021, p. 4). The majority of the literature reviewed, found that usability assessment is crucial for museum websites because of the role that they play in promoting user engagement, educating past and future museum visitors, and maintaining relevance for the physical museum. Kabassi notes that in the early days of museum websites, the main concern was that digitization of museum exhibits for the web would have a negative impact on the number of physical visitors to a museum (2017, p. 194). Their review of studies focused on museum mobile and desktop websites revealed that many studies concluded that a good website could actually increase the desire to physically visit the museum. Kabassi emphasized that while there was not one agreed upon method for evaluating a museum website, heuristic evaluation and usability analysis are critical for museum websites to ensure user satisfaction among potential museum visitors. 


<h3><I>Critical Analysis of the VMFA Website</I></h3>

<p>In 2014 VMFA launched what was then considered a revolutionary redesign of its website with the goal of providing mobile friendly access on tablets and smartphones and providing users with the ability to explore the museum's permanent collection online. Robin Nicholson, the Deputy Director of Art and Education at VMFA stated, "it's been a longtime goal to have the full breath of our permanent collection accessible online anywhere in the world." At the time of that re-launch only 1,450 of the 3,300 works of art on view in the museum could be viewed on the website. The 2014 website redesign was also undertaken to improve navigation, provide improved access to most-requested information, streamline ticketing, and provide easier access to communication and social media channels. <br><br>
Fast-forward to 2025, VMFA unveiled a major website redesign undertaken to make the site more art-forward and provide a more user-friendly experience. In formulating its redesign, VMFA sought input from board members, donors, staff, VMFA members, educators, and the public through a series of listening sessions conducted with design firm Area 17. Like the 2014 redesign, the 2025 project was designed with the goal of inspiring user's curiosity about the collection, providing users with online access to the collection, and providing a seamless, intuitive user experience. </p>
